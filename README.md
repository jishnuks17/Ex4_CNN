Cats vs Dogs classification using Deep Learning . 
In this Keras project, we will discover how to build and train a convolution neural network for classifying images of Cats and Dogs.

CNN is designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features through backpropagation by using multiple building blocks, such as convolution layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
